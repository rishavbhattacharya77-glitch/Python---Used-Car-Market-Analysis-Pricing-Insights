# Python - Used Car Market Analysis & Pricing Insights
Graded Assignment on Python Programming

Background & Context

This dataset contains listings of used cars and their associated attributes, including
price, brand, model year, condition, mileage, fuel type, and location. It is typically
used for market analysis, price prediction, and demand-supply insights in the used
automobile sector. The data reflects real-world car listings and can support
applications in business analytics, machine learning models for price estimation, and
consumer behavior studies.

Objective

The objective of this assignment is to develop hands-on proficiency in data analysis
using the Pandas library in Python. Learners will work with a real-world car listings
dataset to perform essential data wrangling tasks such as loading, cleaning, filtering,
grouping, and summarizing data. By the end of the assignment, learners will be able
to extract meaningful business insights, visualize key trends, and apply foundational
techniques for exploratory data analysis (EDA) in a practical context.
